    "title": "LLMs 101: How Large Language Models Work",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on vast corpora to predict the next token. They use the Transformer architecture with self-attention to weigh relevant parts of the input. During pretraining, models learn broad language patterns; during post-training (alignment), they’re steered to follow instructions safely. Key limits include context window size (how much text they can consider) and tokenization quirks (subwords). Despite zero training on your data, LLMs can still perform many tasks via prompting, few-shot examples, and tool use. For private or frequently changing knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning can bridge the gap.",

    "title": "Prompt Engineering: Patterns That Actually Work",
    "summary": "Good prompts are simple, explicit, and testable. Start with: role (“You are a…”), task/goal, constraints (format, length), and a few examples if needed. Prefer structured outputs (JSON or bullet points). Ask for reasoning only when useful—otherwise keep it hidden to reduce verbosity. Use delimiters (``` or ###) to separate instructions from data. Add evaluation rubrics for consistent quality. When prompts become long or brittle, move repeated instructions into a system message and create lightweight, versioned templates. Measure results with small golden sets; adjust temperature/top-p for creativity vs. determinism; and log failures to refine iteratively.",

    "title": "RAG Basics: When to Retrieve vs. Memorize",
    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches relevant documents at answer time and feeds them into the prompt. It’s ideal when facts change, sources must be cited, or content is private. Pipeline: chunk documents, embed chunks, store vectors, retrieve top-k for a user query, then generate an answer grounded in that context. Hybrid search (lexical + vector) improves robustness, while re-ranking sharpens relevance. Guardrails should restrict the model to provided context, and observability helps debug misses. Use fine-tuning for stable style/skills; choose RAG for dynamic knowledge and cost control. Many production systems combine both.",

    "title": "Vector Databases: The Backbone of Retrieval",
    "summary": "Vector databases store embeddings (numeric vectors) for efficient similarity search. You’ll ingest documents, chunk them, compute embeddings, and index them for fast k-NN queries. Important features: filtering (metadata), hybrid search (BM25 + vector), and consistency controls during updates. Choose distance metric (cosine, dot-product) to match your embedding model. Watch for embedding drift when models change; re-index when necessary. Secure your pipeline (PII, access control), and cache hot results to reduce costs. Benchmarks should measure precision/recall and latency under realistic workloads. Popular options: Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus.",

    "summary": "Agents break tasks into steps, call tools/APIs, and iterate toward goals. Keep initial scope narrow (one tool, one domain) and add capabilities gradually. Core components: planner (choose next action), tool schema (validated inputs/outputs), memory/state (short-term context, optional long-term store), and guardrails (policy checks, rate limits, sandboxing). Observability is essential: trace thoughts, actions, and tool responses. Prefer idempotent tools, and enforce budgets and timeouts to prevent runaway loops. Evaluate with task suites and human-in-the-loop review when impact is high. Start simple; autonomy grows safely with telemetry.",

Validating inputs server-side prevents abuse. Typical tools include web search, databases, calculators, email, and internal APIs. Chain tools carefully—fan-out increases latency and cost. Cache deterministic calls, log tool success/failure rates, and surface errors to users meaningfully. For security, strip secrets from model-visible prompts and rotate credentials. Testing with mocked tools and golden scenarios increases reliability before production rollout.",

    "title": "Fine-Tuning vs. RAG: Picking the Right Lever",
    "summary": "Fine-tuning adapts a model to your tone, format, or proprietary skills using labeled examples. It’s best for stable behaviors you’ll reuse often. RAG brings fresh or private knowledge at inference time without modifying weights. In practice, use RAG to ground answers and fine-tuning to compress routine instructions or teach domain-specific styles. Evaluate both with the same test sets: accuracy, faithfulness, latency, and cost. Beware overfitting in fine-tuning; keep a clean validation split. For multilingual scenarios, verify that embeddings and base models handle target languages well.",

For open-ended tasks, pairwise comparisons and preference models work well; for grounded tasks, verify citations and use exact-match metrics. Track regressions continuously with canary tests and dashboards. Include budget/latency and PII checks. For RAG, measure retrieval quality (nDCG/Recall@k) separately from generation quality to isolate failure points. Close the loop: send misfires back into training data or prompt tweaks.",
