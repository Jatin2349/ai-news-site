    "content_md": "## What is an LLM?\nA Large Language Model predicts the next token in a sequence. Trained on vast text corpora, it learns patterns of language, reasoning shortcuts, and stylistic conventions. It doesn’t “know” like a human; it estimates likely continuations based on its training distribution.\n\n## How LLMs are built\n- **Pretraining:** The model sees text and learns to reconstruct masked/next tokens by minimizing a **loss** (typically cross-entropy). This stage teaches broad language competence.\n- **Fine-tuning & alignment:** The base model is adapted to tasks or safety goals (e.g., supervised fine-tuning and RLHF). This shapes helpful, harmless behavior.\n\n## Architecture basics\n- **Transformer & attention:** Attention lets the model weigh which tokens matter for each prediction.\n- **Context window:** The maximum tokens the model can “see” at once. Larger windows support long documents and multi-turn chats.\n- **Decoding:** Parameters like **temperature**, **top-p**, or **top-k** trade creativity for determinism.\n\n## Strengths\n- Versatile **text generation** (summaries, emails, drafts, code snippets).\n- Strong **generalization** from broad training data.\n- As a **workbench**, LLMs become far more capable when connected to tools (search, databases, code, function calling).\n\n## Limits\n- **Hallucinations:** Confident but wrong statements; ground with sources for critical tasks.\n- **Recency:** Without retrieval or browsing, knowledge is bounded by the training cutoff.\n- **Privacy/IP:** Use private deployments or strict policies for sensitive data.\n\n## Practical tips\n- **Provide context** (key paragraphs, tables, constraints) in the prompt.\n- **Specify output format** (bullets, markdown, or JSON) for easy downstream use.\n- **Cross-check** high-stakes answers with another source/model.\n\nWith these mental models you’ll know when LLMs are enough, and when to add retrieval, tools, or human review."

Work in **stages**: outline → draft → review → final.\n\n## 5-part template\n1. **Role:** \"You are a [role] for [audience].\"\n2. **Goal:** A clear, verifiable deliverable.\n3. **Context:** Facts, constraints, tone, domain.\n4. **Format & limits:** Bullets vs. prose, length, language, structure.\n5. **Examples & criteria:** 1–2 short exemplars + quality bar.\n\n**Reusable template**\n```\nRole: You are [role] for [audience].\nGoal: [deliverable]\nContext: [facts, constraints, tone]\nFormat: [e.g., 5 bullets / valid JSON with fields x,y,z]\nCriteria: [fact-checked, concise, no fluff, cite sources]\nProcess: propose an outline, wait for approval, then write the final.\n```\n\n## Iteration strategies\n- **Targeted feedback:** Call out what to keep, change, add, or remove.\n- **Variants:** Ask for 2–3 styles (concise, formal, casual) and pick the best.\n- **Self-improvement:** \"Rewrite your answer to meet criteria A/B/C\" or \"Improve my prompt for clarity and completeness.\"\n\n## Useful patterns\n- **Sketched reasoning:** \"Show your steps as bullets.\"\n- **Self-check:** \"List 3 potential errors or missing assumptions.\"\n- **Rubric prompts:** \"Score the text on A/B/C (0–5) and propose fixes.\"\n- **JSON mode:** \"Return **only** valid JSON with fields ...\"\n\n## Anti-patterns\n- Vague goals, no audience, no format.\n- Overstuffed prompts with conflicting constraints.\n- No verification for factual claims.\n\n## Mini checklist\n- [ ] Clear goal + role\n- [ ] Relevant context + examples\n- [ ] Defined output format\n- [ ] Plan for outline → draft → review\n\nApply this loop and your outputs will be predictable regardless of the model."
